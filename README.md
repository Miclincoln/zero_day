# VIRTUAL MACHINE (_VAGRANT_)

VM is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

System virtual machines (also termed full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, virtualization-specific hardware, primarily from the host CPUs.
 

# VAGRANT

VirtualBox and Vagrant together allow you to manage and ship isolated development environments. Those isolated environments in the context of the school (and in the future, in the context of acompany) allow you to match the environment we use to automatically check your work.
Although both VirtualBox and Vagrant are widely used in the industry, it doesnâ€™t mean it is the only means to achieve virtualization, and other tools exist with their pros and cons.
